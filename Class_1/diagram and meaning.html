  A diagram creates an experience by guiding the users mind. It is different than other modes of communication because it engulfs the reader, and makes their mind follow what is being laid out. The viewers mind may stray while gazing at visual art or make a connection that is completely unique and personal while reading poetry, but a diagram pulls the reader down the exact way of thought as its creator, by nature.  It requires the viewers full attention, because it is the readers full attention. It creates meaning through creating a simulated experience: of thought or the world around us.
