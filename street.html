    The lamp across the street is flickering and
    I imagine it’s a call for help from some
    world on the other side of this
    folded paper
    		(we occupy the same space)

    It feels too alive to be an accident, like
    he’ Pressing Expanding Contracting
    with desperation: a creature with horns
    with will to live.

    Other times he breaks through with a
    hopelessness that only exists in familiar
    cages,
    like a home, on a star, far
    far away that only rumbles when its dark.

    Here, he’s flickering faster because
    he knows we’re talking about him
    On and off but
    I don’t know Morse code so I can’t be sure?

    So all he can do is poke holes through
    paper through
    void and fog
    between us
    as we carry on with the night.
