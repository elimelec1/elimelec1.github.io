      <h2>What is the relationship between diagram and meaning?</h2>
  <body>
    <div>
  <p1><em><b>Weekly 1:</b><em>
    A diagram creates an experience by guiding the users mind. It is different than other modes of communication because it engulfs the reader, and makes their mind follow what is being laid out. The viewers mind may stray while gazing at visual art or make a connection that is completely unique and personal while reading poetry, but a diagram pulls the reader down the exact way of thought as its creator, by nature.  It requires the viewers full attention, because it is the readers full attention. It creates meaning through creating a simulated experience: of thought or the world around us.

<h3>How is Ayn Rand's philosophy relevant today?</h3>
  <p2><em><b>Weekly 2:</b></em>
    Ayn Rand’s philosophy is still relevant today because the entire foundation of the internet relies upon it. The computer engineers in Silicon Valley that built the internet were heavily influenced by her and created the virtual world as a type of utopia where all humans are free and equal. On the level playing field of virtual privacy, anyone can become important and successful, or a Randian hero. Because of the structure of a computer, a virtual presence is normally an individual experience, which allows each user to choose to follow their own desires whatever way they may take them. Computers were not designed to be shared between more than one person and be a collaborative effort. There is only room for one user at a time, which I think is central to the individual user experience. I think if the internet is properly utilized, people can achieve almost anything and reach their full unique potential. This could form a type of utopia, where everyone can live out their wildest dreams. However, repealing net neutrality poses a huge risk to Randian life on the internet. Addictive platforms such as Instagram and YouTube also limit internet exploration and prevent users from seeing past the curated and constructed world of these corporations.<p2>

<h4> How is materiality manifested in poor images?</h4>
    <p3><em><b>Weekly 3:</b></em>
      Materiality is manifested in poor images because it shows th ephysical process of sharing the meme over time. It has the ability to capture time, something that a new photo cannot. Low resolution photos are inherently anticapitalist.</p3>

<h5>What are the cultural implications of cybernetics?</h5>
<p4><em><b>Weekly 4:</b></em>
  The cultural implication of cybernetics is that we seek to quantify everything and each other in terms of machine. People are quantified by their contribution to the whole and are learned to reduce themselves to one dimensional label of themselves. We pine after categorization, so that someone else may reveal to us who we are in this imaginary machine. Cybernetics removes all free will from the individual, it removes all capacity to make yourself something completely unexpected and out of “character.” Everyone is expected to play a “character” with unchanging opinions and desires.  People are seen as all equal, and we are not encouraged to search for the individuality of those around us. Instead, we simply group them into types and look for similarities that might be arbitrary when looking at the whole. Instead of looking for these patterns to reduce people we might think of using them to discover the uniqueness of a person outside of what we know.</p4>

<h6>How does the Panopticon play out in our contemporary lives?</h6>
<p5><em><b>Weekly 5:</b></em>
  Panopticon plays a huge role in regulating us in our daily lives. We are trained to be “normal” and are constantly monitored by everyone around us. If we are not normal, we are punished by being socially isolated or suffering some sort of social consequence. From a government standpoint, we are expected not to break any rules and feel so scared of being watched we do not even run a red light when there is no one there. If we were to be abnormal, we might rebel against the systems at hand. We might celebrate each others differences instead of condemning them.</p5>

  <h7>How do you understand the dividual? Does this affect your relationship to yourself? </h7>
  <p6><em><b>Weekly 7:</b></em>
    This article talks about the dividual, a part of a larger being that is a continuous source of energy for the molds it works for. We are all cogs in a machine that work for capitalist America and corporations in general. Though we have free will, we will continue to function in this system without question. We even speak collective sentences, repeating phrases that we have heard to garner social approval. I might hear a term and group you in with a certain type of person.</p6>

<h8>How is the work of Pierre Huyghe relational/systemic?</h8>
<p7><em><b>Weekly 8:</b></em>
  Pierre Hyughe’s work is relational/systemic throughout a number of his pieces. As Hauser and Wirth puts it “ Huyghe’s work incites heterotopic conditions of ‘permeability, flow and the indeterminate,’ while simultaneously intensifying the ‘presence of what could be.’” His works interact with themselves, revealing the possibilities of what could happen in that particular real-life situation. One example of this is his video work with the anime character Anlee where he bought the rights to the character and lent it to multiple other artists, watching her story unfold across platforms. He likes to see how people’s interactions unfold across time, such as in his video installation with people in Antarctica. Regardless of the platform, it is interesting what can be uncovered in the land of real time situations. The situation unfolds similarly to the internet, with no way of knowing how it will evolve, and how culture will evolve.</p7>

<h9>What do you think is the role of suffering within the space of this argument?</h9>
<p8><em><b>Weekly 9:</b></em>
  Lyotard states that suffering drives us to think and act, so we can imagine a better world in the end. If we did not suffer, we would not need to think and we would not feel inclined to act and change this world. Suffering is our greatest catalyst as humans to do the things that make us great, and to evolve and overcome something. Without that, machines would not have intelligence, they would not be able to philosophize and advance humanity.</p8>
