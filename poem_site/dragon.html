  I was looking at a tree in
  front of me and I saw
  eyes growing on the leaves.

  I then realized there was a pane of
  glass with scales separating us, and I
  might have been looking at myself.

  There might have been spiders crawling between us
  vertically horizontally not sure which way they’re
  facing or should I be worried?

  But you’re still standing there and my
  eyes are on you looking back at me and
  I think that you’re my favorite version of myself;

  That I grew you before you even called your
  name into a cavern that ripples and pulses,
  because there is water down there.

  “Fall for me baby I’m really safe back
  here I can barely see you.”
  Blinking eyes blank expression no
  remorse.
