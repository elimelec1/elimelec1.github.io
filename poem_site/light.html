        In the Light of the Morning



  Just as the sun chases things that are
  Dark and unseen

  You chase the sun and wonder why you can’t look this
  Feeling in the eyes.

  Why it crawls around your lovers neck like a
  String of diamonds that kaleidoscope

  But you might feel yourself looking into their
  Eyes like a deer in headlights or

  Children in the sun,
  Looking at things that pull

  Without question and God
  Will carry us with golden wings

  To heaven if we just hurt ourselves:
  A reasonable thought for beings

  Trapped in tar dripping with time:::
  That we might be able to join the realm of perfect things

  If we can just capture this feeling before
  It is gone.

  Before it hides in the patterns
  Between stars, with all the other unseen

  Things that are there but
  You might keep looking at the sun,

  The absolute the too good pearl that will
  Burn a hole in your eyes;

  When what you really seek is something that
  Breaks like a diamond

  On a string or a cloud or
  The light that breaks through them,

  Turning, refracting into people you love more like
  Constellations written with truths that

  Change but are real.
