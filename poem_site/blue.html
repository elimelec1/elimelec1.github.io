        Tiny Strings Shaded Blue 


  1.
  I looked up at the moon last night and told it to tell me something new:

  “” it said
  The way I interpreted it is we connect to different parts of each other: people
  strung with strings
  like puppets
  making nets cast from someplace
  far and glittery.
  I saw a land of perfectly balanced scales, and globes of
  tiny mirrors that
   refracted on us when we looked up: 	rainbow prisms
  But we never did
  We would just dance and
  play this game,
  kinda like fishing in this dark river,
  Pulling for something while something pulls back at you
  Maybe because fish are blind

  (they may think
  they can see but
  they are only seeing the
  part that floats
  away)



  2.
  The moon said “” about this girl
  Some think it’s a
  disguise but maybe
  also her demise
  by the way she
  sinks into the desert sand
  and doesn’t float


  Whatever that means.
  you
  may close your eyes and
  lift your elbows through
  your hair
  hello?
  Pepermint flowers are super sharp they could cut



  someone's string until they rock
  back and
  forth



  out of time with the
  rest.
  we keep dancing and she's banging on the
  telephone booth
  crying for someone to
  answer
  and there’s sand in her hair,
  and we all laugh because
  no one is there.



  Like a stalled car in the desert




  3.
  The moon was like “” and we actually saw a stalled car in the desert:


  Covered in rhinestones,
  we get in and bump to Wu Tang Clan and
  she yells because we aren’t going
  anywhere and
  it's just so cool,,,,,,
  ``````Her tears mix with the


  river that was drained there were
  15 bodies discovered
  two years ago and they
  never floated,
  one of her ribs was floating and
  so was poisoned blood
  carried by snakes
  from someplace else


  wait there’s no telephone booth?
  and,

  The moon floods the sky above and
   I try to feel sad
  But I just feel free
  carefree
  floating safe alone
  connected
  strung deep within the river in which
  you drowned.


  4.
  I think the moon said to “” look in
  the river
  And tears might be your
  strength

  The moon and the river might just be the same thing,
  and maybe also that feeling of grief
  that drives you
  forward as it flows but,


  No one close to me has ever died
  so I
  overwhelm myself with
  imaginary losses
  until I can be alone

  to walk across the desert as
  wheels are turning in the sky,
  but I only ever look at my feet:
  tiny strings shaded
   blue
  and I think
  It makes me feel tall as I s
  ink through sand and time to a
  world where I am never alone,
  a black round dome that slithers,
  maybe an egg?



  5.
  So I can never be sure but the moon probably said something along the line of:
  “Be pulled
  And pull
  to someplace

   else.”
