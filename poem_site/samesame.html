        Same, Same, Different

    Fireflies catching in the rain and I’m
    trying to find the balance between hot and
    cold

    18 years have passes and the
    Prophet’s come at last I’m trying not to
    Feel so old

    Words stuck in the telephone receiver
    “hello darling”: time passes when you
    need it most

    Postcard from a place with orange
    Faces orange trees, a purple sparkling coast
    Or

    Driving your car five times past the same street
    corner vhs tape cycling on remembered
    horror

    But we’re rolling

    “Look how pretty it is!” We’ve been
    Staring at the same smooth round
    Chrome circle in the ground for 12 hours but
    We all smile and say awwww

    Repeated conversation

    Decked out situation
    Really comfy words that you know:
    “the ground is really hard,” she says
    “until it starts to snow

    I know
    I feel cold inside this bubble the
    Doo doo doo (the number you have reached is not available now)

    Please call again every day for the rest of your life

    And we’re driving,
    Jingling twinkling forming patterns in
    Unity and shiiiiit let’s cheer
    Conversation consternation prophet from the
    Sky chrome book flying high
    The cloud
    Told me it was an alien

    Back again
    Like the 80s like my mom after
    I fell on the playground at my preschool and
    A big purple plastic play piece fell on my head.

    (that wasn’t funny)

    Childhood memories are though

    When they’re told by people who
    think they were there but were really
    operating mechanical versions of themselves from a
    cool metallic tower in the sky

    Anyways,

    I loved it when we went camping under the moonlight and the
    Dots knew everything they knew who
    Was right

    Now,

    think about that shit three times and
    Go stare at the big reflective sphere with
    Everyone you love.

    Keep turning were all turning

    Treadmills burning we’re sometimes
    Learning, heating up cooling down
    Stepping on bubbles from

    A boiling ground.
