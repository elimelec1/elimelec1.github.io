<u>
Great big backwards movie in the sky </u><br>
I think the way you meet someone really matters.
Like a sneak peak of what is to come.
So if the night you meet someone you watch the sun set and the moon rise and then watch them switch again
maybe it means something

Maybe it means everything will be backwards,
And things will end before they started

Great big backwards movie in the sky

If the night you meet, the light that is given is equal to the light that is taken away,
and the sky is pink when he walks you home,
It might be the first lines of a story
to tell yourself backwards when the credits roll
And you’ll think

“Wow the director did a fabulous job with the stage design”
Flap your boa feathers and think
“Such amazing actors, they never broke character once,
Ok maybe once.”
“But I love how the story ended,
I loved how they didn’t even have a choice”

“The way you meet someone really matters,
Like a sneak peak of what is to come.”
