<u>Birds</u>

  Where do you think the birds are going she asks well,
  when they're not migrating it might be when their parents come home early when they're 16 and they always have to run away
  They don't  know that love is cold and dewy and
   it's easier to miss something from the past then to miss something that hasn't happened yet.
  They might be getting so burnt by the sun that when it gets taken away it's too cold
  So
  they chase the sun and the loud music and the holy fire never thinking you should probably cool down
  Your insides are hot
  But the cold air smells like smoke and clouds and I answer it's probably hard to see it's probably hard to know.
