<em>
<u>Interlude</u>

The nymph Amethyst was on her way to the temple of Artemis to worship,
and she was the was the next mortal he met.
Amethyst cried out to Artemis to save her from being torn apart,

Artemis responded by turning her into a pillar of quartz.


<u>how the world began</u>

Just as the elements of nature were found to have their correspondences in man, that
day the sun stands still in the sky
has correspondences to the ice in my chest, that formed as an ending.

Promises of immortality tell me
it’s time to go backwards;
Tell me that all villains are innocent;
That criminals, darkness, accidents and death, ask for no more than this moment.

I see the children’s hands stretch out towards
A cotton-candy-colored corpse,
And the leaves in the fall.

And the sun turned
Like a flashlight under sheets,
Like the thought of fireflies as tiny whispers so we don’t get caught;
Like
air
too
warm.

And we’re laughing and I’m crying, and
I’m melting; Amethyst
on bleeding
wounds,
As I see myself vanish to the world.
