<em>
<u>indefinite tube</u>

When I listen closely to songs (that are actually tunnels),
I sometimes get sucked in.
First my ear, then my chest, dissolve upwards,
Through walls with tiny grains of age and distance.
Like this moment is a photograph?
And I feel like im swirling
 like liquid on the laminated paper of a captured moment?
And im trying to capture it but this paper wonâ€™t stay still.
I like to think that others are floating with me through this 2 dimensional land.
That I might, by chance, fuse with some other moment,
A swirling mass in a tunnel that might pull for the ears and chests of people lost to me.
